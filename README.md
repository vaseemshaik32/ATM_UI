This is the UI for my real time ATM app

Tech used:-

> React 19.0
> axios - For all the api calls along with well handled responses.
> react-hook_form - To make logins and registerations easy and interactive.
> react-redux - To manage state of the application. Handled page reloads using session storage
> react-router-dom - I used a Hash router to route components
> socket.io.client - for real time chats and updates between users.
> HttpOnly - for securing the jwt tokens instead of using redux or localstorage
> Tailwind CSS classes for clean and easy styling
> the app is hosted on Render.com
> Geolocation API to capture users location and match them with potential exchanges.
